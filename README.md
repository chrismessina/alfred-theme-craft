# Craft Powerpack Theme

Here are two [Alfred Powerpack Themes](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) based on [Craft](https://craft.do), "a fresh take on
documents" for the Mac and iOS ecosystem.

This theme takes advantage of [new Window Blur features](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/16238-alfred-43-pre-release-big-sur-theming-improvements/) for macOS Big Sur that landed in Alfred 4.3. As a result, this theme should be considered experimental and may not display properly on earlier versions of Alfred.

## Installation

Download the zip file below, unzip the file, and then double-click the `.alfredappearance` file to install it.
